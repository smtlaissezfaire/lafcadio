* added nil? operators in query inference 
* Global methods won't interfere with DomainObject methods

0.7.3 -- March 1 2005
* fixed bug with MockObjectStore handling Query#limit.

0.7.2 -- February 26 2005
* WARNING: changed DomainObject one-line directive from
  "link field_name { 'linked_type' => linked_type }" to
  "link linked_type, [ field_name ], [{ other_args }]"
* WARNING: changed dynamic methods like Client.get_invoices to Client.invoices
* Added DomainObject.all, .last, .first, .only, .[]

  LafcadioConfig.set_filename
* DomainObject.table_name defaults to underscored version of class name, not
  camel-case
* children of ContextualService can be instantiated with parameters, and they 
  will be cached based on those parameters
* DomainObject will only do field verification if you're using the
  MockObjectStore; this is far more useful for testing than for live code
* If you're creating a DomainObject, and the hash has a key that doesn't
  correspond to a field, it'll raise an error
* Added DomainObject.get( pk_id ) and DomainObject.get { |dobj| ... }
* You can define a domain class' field name with a Symbol or a String
* DomainObject.method_missing raises the normal error
* When you call ObjectStore#get_<dobj>( linked_dobj ), it looks for a link
  field that matches the domain class type, so you don't have to explicitly
  enter the field name

* ContextualService is more restrictive about accepting methods starting with
  'get_' or 'set_'
* Fixed MapObject.get_class_fields

0.7.1 -- January 27 2005
* LinkField sets the name to the underscored version of the domain class
* ObjectStore#get_< plural domain class >( search_term ) knows to look up a link
  in search_term with an underscored, not camel-case name
* fixed a bug where Query#order_by wouldn't account for a field with a different 
  db_field_name
* one-line directives are underscore, not lower-case camel-case

0.7.0 -- January 20 2005
* fixed bug where requiring lafcadio would cause an empty test case to run

  http://extensions.rubyforge.org/ . Also, Class#get_class was moved to
	Extensions as Module.by_name, and Class#barename was moved to Extensions as
	Module#basename
* DomainObject methods can dispatch to ObjectStore, for example:
  Client#get_invoices dispatches to ObjectStore#get_invoices( client )

  for example: ObjectStore#get_users { |user| user.is_admin }
* LafcadioTestCase is a child of Test::Unit::TestCase
* ContextualService.flush removes the cached version of the service
* Querying against a TextListField, you can call include? as if the value were

  of ints
* All references to "object_type" changed to "domain_class"
* All test case files folded into ts_*.rb files

0.5.2 -- December 1 2004

* Added PrimaryKeyField which is included automatically with a DomainObject's
  fields
* Can do direct query comparisons with a primary key:
  ObjectStore#get_users { |user| user.pk_id.gt( 100 ) }

  then change it interactively with Query#and and Query#or.
* DomainObject's selectively dispatch to ObjectStore: Client#get_invoices

* Query inference handles implicit evaluations of boolean fields:
  ObjectStore#get_users { |user| user.administrator }

* Update gem to include installing lafcadio_schema as an executable
* DomainObject#to_s is now a valid method
* ContextualService can handle a child that's an inner class, like ObjectStore::DbConnection

0.3.6 -- May 20 2004
* WARNING: util/Logger replaced with the logger in log4r
* TextField#valueForSQL handles three apostrophes at the start of a line. (Thanks to Mike Stok for the solution via comp.lang.ruby.)
* When you're doing the insert for an inherited Domain Object, it inserts the parent table first, and child table second. (Thanks to Kaspar Schiess for this patch.)
* Query conditions can handle fields with dbFieldName set to something besides the field's name.
* Fixed hashing behavior of DomainObject and DomainObjectProxy.
* Added BlobField. (Thanks to Kaspar Schiess for this patch.)
* Domain classes with fields defined in XML can define dbFieldName as a field's attribute.
* Added ObjectStore#getDbBridge.
* ObjectStore dispatches queries correctly, so you can run inferred queries.
* ObjectStore was seriously refactored; this shouldn't affect how it looks externally.

0.3.5 -- March 31 2004
* WARNING: Removed a lot of inessential files having to do with HTML, CGI, and XML
* WARNING: Moved ClassUtil methods into Class, DomainUtil methods into DomainObject, StrUtil methods into String and Numeric. Renamed EnglishUtil to English.
* WARNING: Everything is now in a Lafcadio module
* TextField#valueForSQL handles an apostrophe after a newline
* All the library code is now in the /lib/ directory, instead of the /lafcadio/ directory
* You can use the whole library by simply including "lafcadio"
* The Rubygem works now, too!

* Fixed Query::Not#objectType
* Fixed a method dispatching bug in ObjectStore#method_missing
* install.rb installs and deinstalls binaries in /usr/local/bin

* Fixed a bug in TextField#valueForSQL where committing a string value with backslashes before a newline caused a problem with apostrophe escaping
* Fixed a bug where DateField#valueFromSQL needed to handle DBI::Date instead of String because of the move to DBI in 0.3.3
* Condition#getField raises a useful exception if you enter an invalid fieldName
* ClassUtil.getClass raises MissingError if it can't find the class
* Domain classes don't need to live in their own files
* responsibility for manipulating ClassDefinitionXmlParser moved from DomainObject to ObjectType
* You can set a different tableName and sqlPrimaryKeyName in the class definition XML
* added Query::Inferrer, but its interface will change soon so you probably shouldn't use it yet.
* Renamed DomainObject.getField to DomainObject.getClassField
* DomainObject.getField will look in itself and superclasses 
* fixed some tutorial examples

0.3.3 -- November 23 2003
* ClassDefinitionXmlParser#execute raises an informative error message if you forget to define a field's class.
* FieldManager captures the query string.
* MockDbBridge observes a limit set in a Query.
* TimeStampField works with ClassDefinitionXmlParser.
* Lafcadio now uses DBI instead of Ruby/MySQL -- this is the first step towards making Lafcadio compatible with other databases.
* lafcadio_schema correctly creates the field definition for a TimeStampField.

0.3.2 -- October 27 2003
* Fixed a bug in the includer (the class that allows for root-level includeable files to reduce requires) that made it only work if it was searching in the current directory.

0.3.1 -- October 26 2003
* DEPRECATION WARNING: There are now root-level includeable files that can save you from having to type too many includes. You can now include "lafcadio/objectField" to include all files in the objectField directory instead of "lafcadio/objectField/DateField", "lafcadio/objectField/TextField", etc. The individual files will disappear sometime around version 0.5.0.
* Instead of overwriting DomainObject.getClassFields to define fields for a domain class, you now have the option of writing an XML file instead. This method is now the encouraged method, but the old method of overwriting DomainObject.getClassFields will work for the foreseeable future.
* lafcadio_schema needs the config file as an argument flagged with -c.
* Added +, -, prev, next, startDate, and endDate to Month. Also, calling Month.new with no arguments returns the current month.
* SQL logging can be toggled by editing the config file. Insert the line "logSql:y" in the file to turn it on, and make sure to set your logdir value as well.
* Added QueueHash#==.
* Fixed a bug in MockSmtp.lastSubject.

0.3.0 -- October 15 2003
* moved install.rb from /bin to /. /bin is now for scripts that Lafcadio users will use after installation, such as lafcadio_schema.
* created lafcadio_schema script, which reads a DomainObject class definition and creates a create table statement.

0.2.2 -- November 23 2003
* DbBridge disconnects from MySql when it's destroyed.

0.2.1 -- October 6 2003
* Updated changelog.txt and the version number in lafcadio/lafcadio.rb.

0.2.0 -- September 25 2003

* Fixed a bug with ObjectField.englishName.
* Fixed a bug where ObjectField#verify failed with a notNull field and a false value.
