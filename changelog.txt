CHANGELOG

0.3.3 -- November 23 2003
* ClassDefinitionXmlParser#execute raises an informative error message if you forget to define a field's class.
* FieldManager captures the query string.
* MockDbBridge observes a limit set in a Query.
* TimeStampField works with ClassDefinitionXmlParser.
* Lafcadio now uses DBI instead of Ruby/MySQL -- this is the first step towards making Lafcadio compatible with other databases.
* lafcadio_schema correctly creates the field definition for a TimeStampField.

0.3.2 -- October 27 2003
* Fixed a bug in the includer (the class that allows for root-level includeable files to reduce requires) that made it only work if it was searching in the current directory.

0.3.1 -- October 26 2003
* DEPRECATION WARNING: There are now root-level includeable files that can save you from having to type too many includes. You can now include "lafcadio/objectField" to include all files in the objectField directory instead of "lafcadio/objectField/DateField", "lafcadio/objectField/TextField", etc. The individual files will disappear sometime around version 0.5.0.
* Instead of overwriting DomainObject.getClassFields to define fields for a domain class, you now have the option of writing an XML file instead. This method is now the encouraged method, but the old method of overwriting DomainObject.getClassFields will work for the foreseeable future.
* lafcadio_schema needs the config file as an argument flagged with -c.
* Added +, -, prev, next, startDate, and endDate to Month. Also, calling Month.new with no arguments returns the current month.
* SQL logging can be toggled by editing the config file. Insert the line "logSql:y" in the file to turn it on, and make sure to set your logdir value as well.
* Added QueueHash#==.
* Fixed a bug in MockSmtp.lastSubject.

0.3.0 -- October 15 2003
* moved install.rb from /bin to /. /bin is now for scripts that Lafcadio users will use after installation, such as lafcadio_schema.
* created lafcadio_schema script, which reads a DomainObject class definition and creates a create table statement.

0.2.2 -- November 23 2003
* DbBridge disconnects from MySql when it's destroyed.

0.2.1 -- October 6 2003
* Updated changelog.txt and the version number in lafcadio/lafcadio.rb.

0.2.0 -- September 25 2003

* Removed .DS_Store files (these are Mac OS X files that got into the package by accident).
* FieldManager uses CGI#params[] instead of CGI#[].
* DomainObject caches class fields
* Fixed a bug with ObjectField.englishName.
* Fixed a bug where ObjectField#verify failed with a notNull field and a false value.
* Children of DomainObject can safely be compared to nil.
* Values in DomainObjects can be set through a DomainObjectProxy.
* Fixed a bug where Query::Equals#toSql failed with a boolean field and a false value.
